# üö® URGENT: DNS RECORD DELETION ISSUE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

The system is **DELETING ALL DNS RECORDS** when updating URL redirects instead of preserving them.

## üõ°Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION TAKEN

- **‚úÖ SAFETY MODE ENABLED** - All redirect updates are temporarily disabled
- **‚úÖ Individual saves blocked** - Shows error message to prevent further damage
- **‚úÖ Bulk updates blocked** - Shows error message to prevent further damage
- **‚úÖ Enhanced debugging** - Added detailed logging to identify the root cause

## üí• WHAT WAS HAPPENING

When you clicked "Save" to update a redirect URL, the system was:
1. Getting existing DNS records from Namecheap
2. **REPLACING ALL DNS records** with just the URL redirect
3. **DELETING** all other DNS records (A, MX, CNAME, TXT, etc.)

## üîç ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION

The issue is in the `set_domain_redirection` function in `namecheap_client.py`:
- Namecheap's `setHosts` API **replaces all DNS records**
- If `_get_all_hosts` fails to retrieve existing records properly, they get deleted
- The function may not be handling all record types correctly

## üö´ CURRENT STATUS

- **ALL REDIRECT UPDATES DISABLED** until fix is verified
- Users will see: "Redirect updates temporarily disabled for safety"
- Sync operations still work (read-only)
- No further DNS damage can occur

## üîß REQUIRED FIX

1. **Debug the `_get_all_hosts` function** - Find why it's not retrieving all DNS records
2. **Improve DNS record preservation** - Ensure ALL record types are preserved
3. **Add comprehensive testing** - Verify fix doesn't break anything else
4. **Remove safety mode** - Only after thorough testing

## üìã NEXT STEPS

1. Investigate DNS API response structure
2. Fix the DNS record retrieval/preservation logic
3. Test on a non-critical domain first
4. Gradually re-enable functionality
5. Monitor for any issues

## ‚ö†Ô∏è USER IMPACT

- **Redirect updates temporarily disabled**
- **Existing functionality preserved** (viewing, syncing)
- **No further DNS damage possible**
- Users must wait for fix before updating redirects
